# How to Play  
**yù túl chí /y˥˩ tʰul˧˥ t͡ɕʰi˧˥/**  
**• Introduction**  
The game is played between 2 to 4 players. In the starting position there are 28 face-down pieces on the heptagonal board with 29 points, where the center point is the only empty point. There are 4 pieces of each of the 7 types, kān(light, white), sā(water, blue), hòng(fire, red), sré (wood, green), pfǎ(soil, brown), fyuù(wind, black), and fiyè(metal, yellow).  
**• Turns and Moves**  
Each player takes turns, each turn has 4 moves, and the turn player must do 1 of the following for each move: 1. Flip 1 face-down piece up; 2. Swap 2 adjacent face-up pieces; 3. Move 1 face-up piece to its empty adjacent point.  
**• Additional Moves**  
A turn immediately ends upon its last move being used up, but before the turn player uses up the last move of their turn, they can choose to lose 1 point to gain 1 move, and they may do so up to twice per turn.  
**• Penalty**  
When a turn ends, the turn player is deducted 3 points if they did not flip up or remove any piece in that turn.  
**• Foul**  
When a turn ends, the turn player immediately loses and is removed from the game if they have ≤-7 points, or played 6 moves in that turn without flipping up and removing any piece.  
**• Piece Removal and Points**  
If 3 or 4 pieces of the same type are connected, they are removed. If the last piece of a type is moved to a different point, it is also removed. When a move results in x pieces being removed, the turn player gains x points if x≤3, (2x-3) points otherwise.  
**• End of the Game**  
When all pieces are removed or there is only 1 player remaining, the game ends, and the players with the most points win.  

**Note: the in-game tutorial says a player loses if they have ≤7 points when they end their turn; this is wrong. A player only loses if they have ≤-7 points when they end their turn.**
